# YouTube Video Fetcher

This project is a Flask-based server that continuously fetches the latest YouTube videos for a search query, stores them in a SQLite database, along with an API to retrieve the data in a paginated format.

A simple dashboard (via `index.html`) allows you to view and search videos by keywords directly from the browser.

## Features Implemented

### Basic Requirements
- **Periodic YouTube Data Fetching:** The server runs a background thread that calls the YouTube API every 10 seconds using the most recently validated API key. It stores new videos in the SQLite DB.
- **Video Storage:** It saves the title, description, published date, thumbnail URL, and channel title with proper indexing.
- **Paginated GET API:** An endpoint `/videos` returns the stored video list sorted by published datetime in descending order.

### Optimization & Scalability
- Videos are only saved if they arenâ€™t already in the database.
- SQLAlchemy is used for ORM, ensuring better DB management and cleaner abstractions.
- Logs are recorded for video insertion and key failures.

## Bonus Features

- **Multiple API Keys Support:** You can supply multiple API keys. If a quota is exhausted, the system automatically switches to the next available key.
- **API Key Management Endpoint:** Use `/api-keys` to add new API keys dynamically via a POST request.
- **Dashboard (Optional UI):** A lightweight HTML page (`index.html`) lets you search and view stored videos using a keyword search and default load.
